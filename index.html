        <h2>Who is Gertjan?</h2>
        <p>Working in tourism since the start of my working life. Always with a passion for the aviation market. But also for technology. Worked closely with developers and IT on implementing and optimizing current and new systems. Others would discribe me as result driven and analytical. Knows how to analyse issues and complex problems and get to the core of them. Can relay this information in a clear manner for all involved. Learning front end development myself now and making the leap of faith into a new field. Please take the time to review my projects here or visit my Github. Feel free to get in touch via my Social Media.</p>

        <h2>Why front end development?</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in front end development and had people working on this in my social circle. I have done some light coding before in different systems as part of my duties in previous jobs. Eager to learn more and find new career or job opportunities.</p>
        <p>Current I'm a tourism profesional with extensive knowledge of, and experience in, the aviation industry.</p>
